# stats

Some basic stats functions I've been writing as I progress through the Udacity course [Statistics: The Science of Decisions](https://www.udacity.com/course/st095)

The intent is to just load up core.clj in Light Table and play around. If you really want to do stats, use a real library like [Incanter](http://incanter.org)

I'm just putting this up here to keep things in sync across multiple computers, but maybe somebody will find it useful! I might come back to this and make it work in cljs...

There's no tests currently, but all of the functions have been used to solve problems in the course so I think they should be ok. :)

## Usage

Look at the Light Table section at the bottome of core.clj; hopefully that will make sense.
